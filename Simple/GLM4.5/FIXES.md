# Fixes Applied

## Image Issues Fixed

1. **Updated all image URLs** to use proper Unsplash format:
   - Changed from `?w=800&h=600&fit=crop&crop=center` to `?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&h=600&q=80`
   - This ensures proper image formatting and quality

2. **Added SVG fallbacks** for key images:
   - Hero image: wheelchair accessibility theme
   - About section: city street theme
   - These ensure content remains visible even if images fail to load

3. **Implemented image error handling**:
   - Added loading states with shimmer effect
   - Automatic fallback to emoji-based placeholders
   - Visual feedback for failed loads
