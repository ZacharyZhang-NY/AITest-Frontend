## Image Optimization Notes

All images are served with:
- WebP format support via Unsplash's auto-format
- Responsive sizing based on device pixel ratio
- Lazy loading enabled (except hero image)
- Proper aspect ratios to prevent layout shift
- Compressed for web delivery (quality=80)

## Accessibility Compliance

- All images have descriptive alt text
- Decorative images are marked appropriately
- Images do not contain essential text content
- High contrast ratios maintained for readability
- Images support dark mode through CSS filters if needed

## Backup Strategy

If any external image fails to load:
1. CSS background colors provide fallback backgrounds
2. Alt text ensures content remains accessible
3. Layout remains stable with aspect-ratio CSS
4. QA system detects and reports image loading failures
